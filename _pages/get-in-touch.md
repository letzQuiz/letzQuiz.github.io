Hei there! Yes, you! Whether you're interested in collaborating on a pub quiz, exploring new and exciting projects, or just sharing your thoughts and ideas, I'm all ears.

I am constantly trying to expand the pubquiz topics and games with unique and original content and I'm always looking for new  ways to challenge and entertain. If you have a collaboration idea or a unique twist you'd like to propose, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

Beyond my love for quizzes and trivia, I have a keen interest in a range of other fields. Science communication, in particular, holds a special place in my hearts. 
I am always eager to discuss and share my passion while making science accessible and exciting for everyone, trying to close the gap between complex concepts and everyday understanding. 
If you share this passion too, or have a project that aligns with these interests, I’d love to connect and explore potential synergies.

So, whether you're here to propose a new quiz idea, discuss science communication, or simply share a new interest or opportunity, I'd love to hear from you. 
Fill out the form below, or drop me an email at [this address](mailto:quizmaster.lux@gmail.com), and let’s start a conversation!
